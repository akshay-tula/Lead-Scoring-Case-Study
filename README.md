# X Education Lead Conversion Improvement

## Introduction
The problem at hand for X Education involves improving their lead conversion rate by identifying potential leads, or 'Hot Leads,' to focus the sales efforts more effectively. With a historical dataset of around 9000 leads and various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc., the task is to build a model that assigns lead scores. These scores should prioritize leads with higher conversion potential. The goal is to increase the lead conversion rate from its current 30% to approximately 80%. Additionally, handling categorical variables, specifically addressing the 'Select' level akin to a null value, is crucial for accurate modeling and analysis.

## Business Goals
- The company aims to pinpoint 'Hot Leads'â€”the most promising potential leads. 
- It requires a model to assign lead scores, ensuring higher scores correspond to increased conversion chances while lower scores signify lower conversion rates. 
- CEO has set an ambitious 80% lead conversion target.
